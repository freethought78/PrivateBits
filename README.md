# PrivateBits
Peer to peer PGP encrypted chat.

Instructions:

This project is intended to be usable by downloading or distributing a single file: PrivateBits.html

This readme is included simply to let users know how to use the software, 
and does not need to be downloaded or included for any legal or functional reason.

Simply download or save PrivateBits.html

You can run it locally, or browse to it on a remotely hosted server.

It can be hosted anywhere you like, but does not need to be hosted anywhere.

The program currently only supports 2 users at a time.

Send the file to a friend that you would like to chat securely with.
When each of you opens PrivateBits in a web browser, you will recieve your own unique ID.
There is a checkbox in the upper left which is unchecked by default.
When that box is unchecked, you will not recieve incoming connections.
One of the partners should check that box and give his unique ID to his friend.
When your partner enters your ID and presses the connect button, the private PGP encrypted chat will be established.
At any time, you can refresh the page to break the connection, establish a new ID, and dump your old PGP keypair to create a new one.

The keypairs are not stored online at any time.
All messages are sent back and forth without being sent to any computer other than your friend's.


Background:
PrivateBits began as a side project that I began working on in preparation to add networked multiplayer support to a board game engine
that I am currently working on called Virtual Cardboard. Its free to use for any purpose that you see fit within your local legal restrictions.
If there is any interest in the project, some of the most likely features that I might add include:
 * Multi-user chat
 * File Transfer
 * Encrypted Audio and Video support
 
If you would like to see these or any other features implemented, come and let me know with a message attached to a donation.
